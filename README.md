 MLOps with Kubeflow Pipelines  

An **end-to-end MLOps pipeline** built using **Kubeflow Pipelines (KFP)** for scalable, reproducible, and automated machine learning workflows.  
This project demonstrates how to orchestrate data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, deployment, and monitoring in a **production-ready setup**.  

---

## 📌 Features  
- 📂 **Data Preprocessing** – Automated feature engineering & data validation  
- 🤖 **Model Training** – Reproducible training with versioned pipelines  
- 📊 **Evaluation & Metrics** – Track model performance & artifacts  
- ⚡ **Deployment** – Deploy trained models on Kubernetes with Kubeflow  
- 📈 **Monitoring** – Monitor drift, accuracy, and pipeline health  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Kubeflow Pipelines (KFP)**  
- **Docker & Kubernetes**  
- **Python** (ML + pipeline components)  
- **TensorFlow / PyTorch** (depending on model implementation)  
- **MLflow / Metadata Tracking**

🚀 Getting Started
1️⃣ Clone the repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/mlops-kubeflow-pipelines.git
cd mlops-kubeflow-pipelines
2️⃣ Install dependencies
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
3️⃣ Build & Push Docker Images
bash
Copy code
docker build -t <dockerhub-username>/mlops-pipeline:latest .
docker push <dockerhub-username>/mlops-pipeline:latest
4️⃣ Compile & Upload Pipeline
bash
Copy code
python pipelines/compile_pipeline.py
This generates a .yaml pipeline definition which can be uploaded to Kubeflow Pipelines UI or via the KFP SDK.

5️⃣ Run Pipeline via SDK
bash
Copy code
python kfp_client.py
📊 Outputs
✅ Versioned pipelines in Kubeflow UI

✅ Tracked experiment runs with metrics & artifacts

✅ Deployed models running on Kubernetes

✅ Monitoring dashboards for drift & performance

🤝 Contributing
Contributions are welcome! You can:

Add more pipeline components (e.g., hyperparameter tuning, explainability)

Integrate with advanced tracking tools (MLflow, Weights & Biases, Prometheus)

Enhance deployment strategies with CI/CD
